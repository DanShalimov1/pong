# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Pong: Redux"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Imagine a game of pong, except it's a funny story where the two players have their own personalities and further question why they're here as more obstacles
get added each round.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

To start, the print command will be used a lot when generating dialogue between the two players. The features that I 
will be using consist of a couple of imports. When recreating the game of pong and adding more obstacles as the rounds
go on, the turtle import will be used heavily to further simulate the game. To make things more lively and humorous,
when generating dialogue between the two players, using the package manager "PIP", I will install "pyttsx3" 
into the environment of my program and use it to make it sound like both players are speaking to each other.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not combining with anything at the moment.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I'm working individually.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I feel like I'll be able to write a funny conversation between the two players when printing out the dialogue.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is the consistency of the obstacles that get added as the rounds of pong go on.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome that I think would take quite some time to do that I hope I would accomplish, is successfully utilizing the
extra obstacles when the rounds continue to go on.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some skills I might have to research include further researching of the turtle import in which more objects than just an
arrow and/or a turtle shape are utilized and how they move around in specific ways. A good starting point would be a 
tutorial on how to accurately recreate pong. After recreating pong, then research on how I can modify to add more obstacles
rather than two players and a ball. This means I'll have to further research the turtle import and what I can do to 
add on to the game of pong to make it more intriguing and more the dialogue between the two players to make more sense.
