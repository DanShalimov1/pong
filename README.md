# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

An idea I have for the final project is recreating the game of pong, and 
modify it by adding some extra obstacles such as some bars raining down 
to interrupt the pong ball between both sides. 
Another catch for this that I thought up of, 
is that depending on what side wins the round, 
humorous dialogue comes into play in which the opposing 
party starts cracking jokes towards the home player, 
and this goes on for a certain number of rounds until 
the program ends.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'm working individually

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No questions at the moment
